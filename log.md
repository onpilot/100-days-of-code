# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is awesome (when joined with FontAwesome, no pun). jQuery is great and Sass is cool, but the syntax... skull :skull:

### Day 2: December 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about creating, composing and rendering React components on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using and overriding default props, state of components, 'this' keyword binding, and lifecycle method in React.

**Thoughts:** 'this' keyword in JavaScript is probably semantically too good it may cause confusion in the head. Just in the head, right?

### Day 4: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using inline styles, adding event listener, using if-else and ternary expression for conditional rendering in React.

**Thoughts:** Already managed to figure out some basic functionality, but still struggled with React. However, perfection need time, right? And remember, patience is a virtue.

### Day 5: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed React challenges with learning ways of conditional rendering using props, state .map() and .filter().

**Thoughts:** Really glad to complete the challenges. Will review again tomorrow. Can't wait to start learning Redux!

### Day 6: December 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired here ...

### Day 7: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to connect React with Redux.

**Thoughts:** Still need a way to catch up with React components hierarchy as the application grows complex. Need a plugin to help maybe?

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
