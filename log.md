# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is awesome (when joined with FontAwesome, no pun). jQuery is great and Sass is cool, but the syntax... skull :skull:

### Day 2: December 9, 2021

### Day 3: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using and overriding default props, state of components, 'this' keyword binding, and lifecycle method in React.

**Thoughts:** 'this' keyword in JavaScript is probably semantically too good it may cause confusion in the head. Just in the head, right?

### Day 4: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using inline styles, adding event listener, using if-else and ternary expression for conditional rendering in React.

**Thoughts:** Already managed to figure out some basic functionality, but still struggled with React. However, perfection need time, right? And remember, patience is a virtue.

### Day 5: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed React challenges with learning ways of conditional rendering using props, state .map() and .filter().

### Day 7: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to connect React with Redux.

**Thoughts:** Still need a way to catch up with React components hierarchy as the application grows complex. Need a plugin to help maybe?

### Day 8: December 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning to setup local dev environment for React using CRA (create-react-application), NextJS, and Parcel 2.

**Thoughts:** So far, I prefer NextJS over Parcel 2, mainly because the node modules size. But for now, I'll just stick with CRA and let's see what will coming up.

### Day 9: December 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement local debugging using Chrome and adding typescript into my project.

**Thoughts:** Everything is slowly getting better.

### Day 10: December 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing React fundamentals from FreeCodeCamp React Course Video on my local dev environment.

**Thoughts:** John Smilga is very informative, and funny.

**Thoughts:** It's not a pause. It's a pause jump squats.

### Day 12: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Messing with my OpenCore Mac installation, so now I switch back to Windows for coding.

**Thoughts:** Does Mac really more powerfull over Windows for web development? Idk, but couldn't agree more that Mac UI/UX is really delightful.

### Day 13: December 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installing PowerShell 7. Adding [PSReadline](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine), [PSFzf](https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf), and [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) modules.

**Thoughts:** Definitely pleased that finally I can experience a powerfull terminal in Windows machine.

### Day 14: December 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still reviewing useState hook on React.

**Thoughts:** It's still a bit confusing when implementing useState on array, why should we use an arrow function to invoke it?
