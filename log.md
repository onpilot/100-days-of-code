# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is awesome (when joined with FontAwesome, no pun). jQuery is great and Sass is cool, but the syntax... skull üíÄ

### Day 2: December 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about creating, composing and rendering React components on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** There's still a long journey to go. Tomorrow, the world! üåéÔ∏è

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 3: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using and overriding default props, state of components, 'this' keyword binding, and lifecycle method in React.

**Thoughts:** 'this' keyword in JavaScript is probably semantically too good it may cause confusion in the head. Just in the head, right?

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 4: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using inline styles, adding event listener, using if-else and ternary expression for conditional rendering in React.

**Thoughts:** Already managed to figure out some basic functionality, but still struggled with React. However, perfection need time, right? And remember, patience is a virtue.

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 5: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed React challenges with learning ways of conditional rendering using props, state .map() and .filter().

**Thoughts:** Really glad to complete the challenges. Will review again tomorrow. Can't wait to start learning Redux!

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 6: December 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired here ...

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 7: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to connect React with Redux.

**Thoughts:** Still need a way to catch up with React components hierarchy as the application grows complex. Need a plugin to help maybe?

**Link to Challenges:** [FreeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

### Day 8: December 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning to setup local dev environment for React using CRA (create-react-application), NextJS, and Parcel 2.

**Thoughts:** So far, I prefer NextJS over Parcel 2, mainly because the node modules size. But for now, I'll just stick with CRA and let's see what will coming up.

### Day 9: December 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement local debugging using Chrome and adding typescript into my project.

**Thoughts:** Everything is slowly getting better.

### Day 10: December 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing React fundamentals from FreeCodeCamp React Course Video on my local dev environment.

**Thoughts:** John Smilga is very informative, and funny.

### Day 11: December 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: ~

**Thoughts:** It's not a pause. It's a pause jump squats.

### Day 12: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Messing with my OpenCore Mac installation, so now I switch back to Windows for coding.

**Thoughts:** Does Mac really more powerfull over Windows for web development? Idk, but couldn't agree more that Mac UI/UX is really delightful.

### Day 13: December 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installing PowerShell 7. Adding [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), [PSFzf](https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf), and [Get-ChildItemColor](https://github.com/joonro/Get-ChildItemColor) modules.

**Thoughts:** Definitely pleased that finally I can experience a powerfull terminal in Windows machine.

### Day 14: December 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continue React tutorial. Reviewing useState and useEffect.

**Thoughts:** ...

### Day 15: December 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #1

**Thoughts:** It's still a bit confusing when implementing useState on array.

**‚ùìÔ∏è:** Why should we use an arrow function in event handler to alter array state?

### Day 16: December 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #2

**üí°:** React local state can be used either in ES6 Class syntax or in Stateless Functional Component. The former is done by using 'this' keyword and binding. The latter is done by using destructuring assignment: 2D array ([state, setState]) assigned to React.useState invoking our data.

### Day 17: December 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #3

**üí°:** Day 15 question answered. To use an event handler that requires arguments, I should use a higher-order function.

**Thoughts:** So, I decide to restart my basic knowledge of React following "The Road to Learn React" book by Robin Wieruch. It is said that _there are performance implications of using arrow function in event handlers_, but it should be wise to focus on learning React first.

### Day 18: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about useEffect from the FreeCodeCamp tutorial video on YT.

**Thoughts:** I'm stuck on "Getting Real with an API" section in the "The Road to Learn React" book, but I need to learn about fetching data in React, so I move back and continue my latest progress on FCC's React tutorial video. And today, I learned about how to use useEffect to change document title html element, add event listener (and how to clean it up) as well as fetching a json data from an API using async/await, and how to add second parameter (dependency list).

### Day 19: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Using the lessons I've learned up till now, I'll try to build my first front end development libraries projects @freeCodeCamp, random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** Guess I'll start with the logic first, then the UI after. Hope it will end up well :green_heart:

### Day 20: December 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done building the logic of my random quote machine app.

**Thoughts:** Let's move forward with styling tomorrow. Oh, I almost forget today is the last day of 2021. I'm truly grateful for what I've learnt so far. Thank you to everyone that help and support me through this rough year. Happy new year.

### Day 21: :star2: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement some styling into my random quote machine app with Material UI.

**Thoughts:** Until I find a better solution, let's struggle with CSS again.

### Day 22: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Exploring some CSS frameworks/library for React. Found Material UI and Tailwind CSS pretty amazing.

**Thoughts:** Which is easier for maintenance for a small-to-medium-scale app in the long term? I found Tailwind CSS is very interesting, but requires time to learn.

### Day 23: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Creating personal github page and react github pages for my portfolio showcases after completing freeCodeCamp Front-End Library course.

### Day 24: January 4, 2022

### Day 27: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn about Sass, Less, and CSS Modules basics.

**Thoughts:** I used to simply go with CSS frameworks. But, I know today that I really should learn more about CSS.

### Day 28: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing Sass features: 1) Store data with Sass variables, 2) Nest CSS, 3) Create reusable CSS with mixins

### Day 29: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Try implementing 3 common ways of styling React applications: 1) using Sass (or the traditional CSS), 2) CSS-in-JS (eg. styled-components, emotion-js), 3) CSS Modules (eg. vanilla-extract).

**Link to article**: https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-with-sass-support/

### Day 30: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 1) Learning more about git command, gh cli and ssh. 2) Trying to use yarn for installing npm package that requires node addons.

### Day 31: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Try implementing CSS Modules. Learning more about CSS-in-JS.

**Thoughts:** Use CSS-in-JS to 1) reduce the number of HTTP request, 2) use styling fragmentation.

**Link to article**: [CSS Modules](https://www.robinwieruch.de/create-react-app-css-modules/), [React Styled Components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-styled-components/)

### Day 32: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning to create a Messenger bot using [bottender](https://github.com/Yoctol/bottender) JavaScript framework API.

### Day 33: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: It's still a bit hard for me to have a good grasp in bottender API. I will stop for now. üõë

### Day 34: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Initiating Markdown Previewer app, my second project for freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects + reviewing react fundamentals again.

**Thoughts:** Still didn't really sure when to use state over props and vice versa.

### Day 35: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continue working with my Markdown Previewer app, using `marked` javascript external plugin.

### Day 36: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning about React DOM elements.

**Thoughts:** React implements a browser-independent DOM system for cross-browser compatibility. There are a number of attributes that work differently between React and HTML such as: `checked`, `className`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

**Link to article**: [React DOM Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html)

### Day 37: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 1) Learning about HTML DOM innerHTML property. The `innerHTML` is a property of the `Element` that allows you to get or set the HTML markup contained within the element. 2) install html5-boilerplate using create-html5-boilerplate script for code sandboxing with JavaScript;

**‚ùóÔ∏è**: HTML5 specifies that a `<script>` tag inserted with innerHTML should not execute. When inserting user-supplied data, one should always consider using `Element.SetHTML()` _in order to sanitize the content before it is inserted_ or use a sanitize library, like `DOMPurify`, `sanitize-html` or `insane` to prevent potential XSS attacks

**Link to article**: [Element.innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML), [InnerHTML](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-innerhtml/)

### Day 38: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 1) Continue working with my Markdown Previewer app. Using DOMPurify library to sanitize the input on `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute.

**Thoughts:** One alternative to the original `marked` plugin is to use `marked-react`, which internally uses `marked` to render the html elements as react components (avoiding the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) [as explained in this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34686523/using-marked-in-react/34688574). However, it is not clear how the internal process works, like if `marked-react` sanitize the content prior rendering.

### Day 39: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finish my Markdown Previewer app setup to comply with FCC requirements.

**Thoughts:** It's been fun. Little by little, I can enjoy building an app on top of React library.

### Day 40: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Adding `github-markdown-css`, to replicate the GitHub Markdown style, into the project. Fix the layout.

**Link to work** üíö: [Markdown Previewer](https://onpilot.github.io/markdown-previewer/)

### Day 47: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Initiating calculator app project.

### Day 48: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning Figma to create better design layout and scheme for an app along with its components. So by the time I start to code the app, I won't get derailed from one to other ideas over and over again.

### Day 49: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Defining initial layout for calculator app.

### Day 50: February 4, 2022

### Day 60: February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Working with setInterval and clearInterval.

### Day 61: February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Still working with the set and clear interval. Also make the app into smaller components for easier maintenance as well as easier styling with `styled-components` later.

**üí°:** When using `setInterval` in react, store it into the state so you can do `clearInterval` easily later on.
