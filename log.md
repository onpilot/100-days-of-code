# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is awesome (when joined with FontAwesome, no pun). jQuery is great and Sass is cool, but the syntax... skull :skull:

### Day 2: December 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about creating, composing and rendering React components on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** There's still a long journey to go. Tomorrow, the world! :earth_americas:

### Day 3: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using and overriding default props, state of components, 'this' keyword binding, and lifecycle method in React.

**Thoughts:** 'this' keyword in JavaScript is probably semantically too good it may cause confusion in the head. Just in the head, right?

### Day 4: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about using inline styles, adding event listener, using if-else and ternary expression for conditional rendering in React.

**Thoughts:** Already managed to figure out some basic functionality, but still struggled with React. However, perfection need time, right? And remember, patience is a virtue.

### Day 5: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed React challenges with learning ways of conditional rendering using props, state .map() and .filter().

**Thoughts:** Really glad to complete the challenges. Will review again tomorrow. Can't wait to start learning Redux!

### Day 6: December 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired here ...

### Day 7: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to connect React with Redux.

**Thoughts:** Still need a way to catch up with React components hierarchy as the application grows complex. Need a plugin to help maybe?

### Day 8: December 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning to setup local dev environment for React using CRA (create-react-application), NextJS, and Parcel 2.

**Thoughts:** So far, I prefer NextJS over Parcel 2, mainly because the node modules size. But for now, I'll just stick with CRA and let's see what will coming up.

### Day 9: December 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement local debugging using Chrome and adding typescript into my project.

**Thoughts:** Everything is slowly getting better.

### Day 10: December 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing React fundamentals from FreeCodeCamp React Course Video on my local dev environment.

**Thoughts:** John Smilga is very informative, and funny.

### Day 11: December 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: ~

**Thoughts:** It's not a pause. It's a pause jump squats.

### Day 12: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Messing with my OpenCore Mac installation, so now I switch back to Windows for coding.

**Thoughts:** Does Mac really more powerfull over Windows for web development? Idk, but couldn't agree more that Mac UI/UX is really delightful.

### Day 13: December 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installing PowerShell 7. Adding [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), [PSFzf](https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf), and [Get-ChildItemColor](https://github.com/joonro/Get-ChildItemColor) modules.

**Thoughts:** Definitely pleased that finally I can experience a powerfull terminal in Windows machine.

### Day 14: December 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continue React tutorial. Reviewing useState and useEffect.

**Thoughts:** ...

### Day 15: December 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #1

**Thoughts:** It's still a bit confusing when implementing useState on array.

**:question::** Why should we use an arrow function in event handler to alter array state?

### Day 16: December 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #2

**:bulb::** React local state can be used either in ES6 Class syntax or in Stateless Functional Component. The former is done by using 'this' keyword and binding. The latter is done by using destructuring assignment: 2D array ([state, setState]) assigned to React.useState invoking our data.

### Day 17: December 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing useState hook #3

**:bulb::** Day 15 question answered. To use an event handler that requires arguments, I should use a higher-order function.

**Thoughts:** So, I decide to restart my basic knowledge of React following "The Road to Learn React" book by Robin Wieruch. It is said that _there are performance implications of using arrow function in event handlers_, but it should be wise to focus on learning React first.

### Day 18: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning about useEffect from the FreeCodeCamp tutorial video on YT.

**Thoughts:** I'm stuck on "Getting Real with an API" section in the "The Road to Learn React" book, but I need to learn about fetching data in React, so I move back and continue my latest progress on FCC's React tutorial video. And today, I learned about how to use useEffect to change document title html element, add event listener (and how to clean it up) as well as fetching a json data from an API using async/await, and how to add second parameter (dependency list).

### Day 19: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Using the lessons I've learned up till now, I'll try to build my first front end development libraries projects @freeCodeCamp, random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** Guess I'll start with the logic first, then the UI after. Hope it will end up well :green_heart:

### Day 20: December 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done building the logic of my random quote machine app.

**Thoughts:** Let's move forward with styling tomorrow. Oh, I almost forget today is the last day of 2021. I'm truly grateful for what I've learnt so far. Thank you to everyone that help and support me through this rough year. Happy new year.

### Day 21: :star2: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement some styling into my random quote machine app with Material UI.

**Thoughts:** Until I find a better solution, let's struggle with CSS again.

### Day 22: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Exploring some CSS frameworks/library for React. Found Material UI and Tailwind CSS pretty amazing.

**Thoughts:** Which is easier for maintenance for a small-to-medium-scale app in the long term? I found Tailwind CSS is very interesting, but requires time to learn.

### Day 23: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Creating personal github page and react github pages for my portfolio showcases after completing freeCodeCamp Front-End Library course.

### Day 24: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing some CSS basic concepts on [Google web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css).

### Day 25: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refreshing CSS basic concepts on new (beta) responsive web design course by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

### Day 26: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finish the first Front-end development library project on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

### Day 27: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn about Sass, Less, and CSS Modules basics.

**Thoughts:** I used to simply go with CSS frameworks. But, I know today that I really should learn more about CSS.

### Day 28: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing Sass features: 1) Store data with Sass variables, 2) Nest CSS, 3) Create reusable CSS with mixins

### Day 29: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Try implementing 3 common ways of styling React applications: 1) using Sass (or the traditional CSS), 2) CSS-in-JS (eg. styled-components, emotion-js), 3) CSS Modules (eg. vanilla-extract).
